    <h3>step by step instructions</h3>
    <div class="two"> <ol>
        <li>preheat the oven to 175c or 350f for at least 15mins.<br>
             grease and line 2-6 inch cake pans. you can also make a single layer cake<br> 
             in a 7 or 8 inch pan. you can also just grease and dust with some flour or cocoa.</li>
        <li>place a sieve over a mixind bowl add flour.</li>
        <li>add the rest of the dry ingredients- cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. sieve them all.</li>
        <li>next add sugar</li>
        <li>mix everything well until uniform. make a well in the center</li>
        <li>heat half cup water in a pot. (don't add the water here).<br>
             meanwhile pour milk, egg, oil and vanila to the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>whisk the wet ingredients frist. then whisk together wet and dry ingredients<br>
             just until combined. do not over mix</li>
        <li>you will have a slightly thick batter at this stage.</li>
        <li>quickly pour the hot water to the batter. the water must be very hot</li>
        <li>immediately whisk the batter just until the water is absorbed and the batter <br>
            looks uniform. batter is very runny at this stage</li>
        <li>pour this to the pans. tap the pan to the counter 2 to 3 times.</li>
        <li>bake for 28 to 30mins or until the tester comes out clean. please adjust the timing depending <br>
            on the oven and pan sizes. if baking in a 7 inch pan you may need to bake up to 35 to 38mins. cool the pans on a wire rack for 10mins</li>
        <li>then invert to a cooling rack. cool completly before frosting</li> 
        <h3>frosting chocolate cake</h3>
        <li>spread a tsp of frosting in the center of the cake board or cake stand. place 4 parchment<br>
             papers on all 4 sides such that they don't touch the frosting. place the cake on the parchment pap[er. the center of the<br>
              cake has to be on the frosting that was spread. begin to spread the frosting with a spatula. even out for smooth surface. place<br>
               another cake and repeat the frosting. then frost on the sides. smoothen the sides as well with the spatula.</li>
        <li>i just used choco chips and sprinkles on the top. then remove the parchment paper gently</li>
        <li>all done! now you may slice the classic chocolate cake.</li>
